This is a repository of scripts to help you create 2 line scripts for ALX bash scripting programs and also helps you easily push your changes to github.

## How to setup:

Clone the project into any directory on your machine, and cd to the project directory.  Once inside, execute the install.sh script to move every script to your/bin folder for global accessibility.

To view instructions on each added scripts, please select the folder and read the README file attached to them to understand their usage.

I will be adding more scripts as i find repeated tasks in during this program, so watchout fo this space!
